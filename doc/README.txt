I am to build an expression evaluator that will evaluate 
any mathematical equation the user enters.  It should allow 
for adding, subtracting, division, and multiplication, as 
well as parentheses.  It should also follow the rules of 
precedence.

CS240 Assignment 2

My approach to this project was to first make the stack interface and then the ListStack class.  After that I made a test program, to make sure it worked.  I decided to use the LinkedList from assignment 1 for the basis of the stack.  Then I implemented the parentheses and made sure that it worked with adding and subtracting.  Then I implemented the division operator, and finally the multiplication operator, since that one was the most complicated.  Then I made the exceptions and the main interface, and did some test cases and fixed any problems I came across.

This assignment really helped me understand the internal structure of stacks and how to use them in new ways.  It took a while to get used to the process, and I had to write down all the processes while running it for testing, but eventually I was able to get through it with little to no full fledged writing it out.
